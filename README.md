# gh-my

I was messing around with the graph api, and this was the result because who wants to navigate a web UI when you have a terminal. If like me, you don't pay much attention to issues raised on your public repos, then this is marginally useful

This is an extension for [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) that just lists any issues/prs raised in your personal repos along with some handy queries that I've found useful.

## Installation

Prerequisites:

- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) is already installed and authenticated
- [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is installed
- `column` which is a standard linux tool; already present in _git+bash_ on windows; via _util-linux_ on ubuntu.
- `date` needs to support the `--date "14 days ago"` style option.

To install this extension:

```
gh extension install quotidian-ennui/gh-my
```

## Usage

```shell
bsh ❯ gh my

Usage: gh my [deployments|failures|help|issues|notifs|prs|report|reviews|vulns|workload] [options]
  issues      : list issues in your personal repositories
  prs         : list PRs in the current repository or all your personal repos
  reviews     : list PRs where you've been asked for a review
  workload    : list PRs and issues where you are the assignee
  deployments : list deployments awaiting action on the default branch
  report      : show all the issues & prs you've been involved in the last 14 days
                (because you have to tell people what you've done)
  notifs      : list unread notifications
  failures    : show workflow failures in your personal repositories in the last 14 days
  vulns       : show vulnerability alerts from dependabot in your personal repositories

'issues' can have its output in JSON format
'reviews' can have its output in JSON format
'workload' can have its output in JSON format
  -j : output each row as a JSON object.
       This is useful if you want to script & pipe the output.
       (--jsonlines is also accepted)

'prs' shows the PRs in the current repo by default.
  -a : PRs in all your personal repositories
       This is the default behaviour if your current location
       is not a github repo and should be explicitly set if
       it is.
  -j : output each row as a JSON object.

'deployments' needs more filters
  -o : the organisation (e.g. -o my-company)
  -t : the topic  (e.g. -t my-terraform-repos)
  -r : a specific repository, but why not use gh run list instead?

'report' uses 'date' so any gnu date string is valid
  -d : the date string (default is "14 days ago")
  -q : omit the table headers
  -a : use 'author' instead of 'involves'
  -v : everything involving your user (e.g. where you're a CODEOWNER)
  -j : output each row as a JSON object.

'failures' uses 'date' so any gnu date string is valid
  -d : the date string (default is "14 days ago")

'notifs' can also mark them as read
  -n : the ID to mark as read (-n 7235590448)
  -a : Mark all notifications as read

'vulns' can have more filters
  -o : the owner (e.g. -o my-company | -o my-user)
       default is whatever 'gh config get user -h github.com' returns
       ** Viewing security alerts implies permissions
  -j : output each row as a JSON object.
```

```bash
bsh ❯ gh my issues
Num  Title                  Who     URL                                                          When
#1   能增加Apple芯片支持吗？  binge6  https://github.com/quotidian-ennui/homebrew-zulufx/issues/1  2 years ago

bsh ❯ gh my issues -j
{"createdAt":"2021-03-02T01:18:10Z","login":"binge6","number":1,"title":"能增加Apple芯片支持吗？","url":"https://github.com/quotidian-ennui/homebrew-zulufx/issues/1"}
```

> I have ignored the above issue since it was raised, I don't have a Mac any more, and certainly not one that is M1/M2 etc. If someone wants to add in arm64 support for zulufx then please do so, and comment on this issue! I'm a little bit embarrassed that I've never dealt with it.

### deployments

Because of <https://github.com/quotidian-ennui/gh-my/issues/2> you can now list deployments that are waiting for someone to approve them (perhaps you're doing something like this : <https://warman.io/blog/2023/03/fixing-automating-terraform-with-github-actions/>). The usage model is geared towards you filtering either explicitly by repository (in which case you can probably do `gh run list -R <repo> -s "waiting"` instead, but is present for completeness) or by organisation + topic.

```bash
bsh ❯ gh my deployments -o telus-agcg -t tpm-demeter
ID          URL                                                                               Branch  Repo                                   Env            Actionable  When
5357752484  https://github.com/telus-agcg/tpm-demeter-terraform-test/actions/runs/5357752484  main    telus-agcg/tpm-demeter-terraform-test  main-approval  false       3 days ago

bsh ❯ gh my deployments -r telus-agcg/retro-cdc
ID          URL                                                              Branch  When
5388868900  https://github.com/telus-agcg/retro-cdc/actions/runs/5388868900  main    3 hours ago
```

### JSON output

The json output is a direct consequence of #46 because we want to oneliner things and using awk may end up being too brittle. The output is a json object per line, so you can use `jq` to filter the output.

```bash
bsh ❯ gh my reviews -j | grep "bump hashicorp" | jq -c -r '.url' | xargs -L 1 gh pr view --comments | grep "Terraform Plan"
#### Terraform Plan :book: `unchanged`
bsh ❯ gh my reviews -j | grep "bump hashicorp" | jq -c -r '.url' | xargs -I {} bash -c "gh approve {} && gh squash-merge {}"
```

- If you don't like JSON lines output then you can convert it into CSV if that's your bag since the keys are consistent across the output (normally you wouldn't be able to assume this with jsonl).

```bash
bsh ❯ gh my prs -j -a | jq --slurp | yq -p j -o csv
